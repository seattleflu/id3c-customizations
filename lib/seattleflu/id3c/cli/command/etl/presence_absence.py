"""
Process presence-absence tests into the relational warehouse

The ETL process performs a `find_or_create` for targets, as we anticipate the same targets to be tested, but leave room for the addition of new targets.

The ETL process performs a `find_or_create` for samples to allow the processing of re-tested samples. We do not expect to update information of a sample itself.

The ETL process performs an `upsert` for presence_absence to allow the update of results should there be a re-test on an old sample.

The presence-absence ETL process will abort under these conditions:

1. If a sample's barcode matches with a UUID that is of the incorrect identifier set

2. If we receive an unexpected value for the "controlStatus" of a target

3. If we receive an unexpected value for the "targetResult" of a specific test
