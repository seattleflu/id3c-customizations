This directory contains location data we use in ID3C for the Seattle Flu Study
and code for importing it.


## Commands

Snakemake is used to fetch and import files.  There are two primary commands:

* __download__: Fetches geospatial data from the US Census website.  This
  should be run as few times as possible, as the Census temporarily bans repeat
  downloaders.  Similar, it should not be run in parallel.

* __import__: Imports locations from geospatial data into ID3C.  This expects
  that a clone of the ID3C source code is a sibling to the clone of this
  repository.  If it's not, set the `ID3C` environment variable appropriately.


## Data

Files stored in the `data/` directory are:

* `states.txt` contains a mapping of ANSI FIPS codes and USPS abbreviations for
  all states, as described at
  <https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/ansi_statetables.html>.  This file was
  downloaded unmodified from
  <http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/reference/state.txt>.

* `2010_Census_Tract_to_2010_PUMA.txt` contains a mapping of Census tracts to
  PUMAs (which use tracts as their geographical building block), letting us
  establish tracts under PUMAs in our location catalog hierarchy.  This file
  was downloaded unmodified from
  <https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/rel/2010_Census_Tract_to_2010_PUMA.txt>.

* `SeattleCensusBlocksandNeighborhoodCorrelationFile.xlsx` contains a mapping of
  Census tracts to neighborhood districts within Seattle, letting us establish
  tracts under neighborhood_district in our location catalog hierarchy. This file
  was downloaded unmodified from
  <https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/OPCD/Demographics/GeographicFilesandMaps/SeattleCensusBlocksandNeighborhoodCorrelationFile.xlsx>.

* `2010_Census_Tract_Hierarchy.csv` contains a mapping of Census tracts to 4 levels
  hierarchy: neighborhood_district, puma, state, country. This is generated by
  running `snakemake hierarchy`, which merges data from `2010_Census_Tract_to_2010_PUMA.txt`
  and `SeattleCensusBlocksandNeighborhoodCorrelationFile.xlsx`.

* `tract/tl_2016_${state_fips_code}_tract.zip` contain the 2016-vintage Census
  tract Shapefiles, as described at
  <https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html>.

  These are not checked into version control and must be downloaded locally by
  running `snakemake download`.  Do not download the files in parallel or
  repeatedly or the Census will likely ban your IP address!

* `tract/cb_2016_${state_fips_code}_tract_500k.zip` contain the 2016-vintage Census
  tract cartographic boundary Shapefiles, as described at
  <https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/technical-documentation/naming-convention/cartographic-boundary-file.html>.

  These are also not checked into version control and must be downloaded
  locally by running `snakemake download`.  Do not download the files in
  parallel or repeatedly or the Census will likely ban your IP address!

* `puma/tl_2016_${state_fips_code}_puma10.zip` contain the 2016-vintage PUMA Shapefiles,
  as described at <https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html>.

  These are also not checked into version control and must be downloaded locally by
  running `snakemake download`.  Do not download the files in parallel or
  repeatedly or the Census will likely ban your IP address!

* `puma/cb_2016_${state_fips_code}_puma10_500k.zip` contain the 2016-vintage PUMA
  cartographic boundary Shapefiles, as described at
  <https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/technical-documentation/naming-convention/cartographic-boundary-file.html>.

  These are also not checked into version control and must be downloaded
  locally by running `snakemake download`.  Do not download the files in
  parallel or repeatedly or the Census will likely ban your IP address!

* `cra/seattle_cra.geojson` is the GeoJSON of Seattle's Community Reporting Areas that are
  downloaded from <https://gisdata.seattle.gov/server/rest/services/COS/CommunityReportingAreas/MapServer/0>

  These are also not checked into version control and must be downloaded
  locally by running `snakemake download`.

* `neighborhood_district/seattle_neighborhood_district.geojson` is the GeoJSON of Seattle's neighborhood districts
  that is generated from combining CRAs within `cra/seattle_cra.geojson`.

  These are also not checked into version control and must be generated
  locally by running `snakemake cra_to_neighborhood_district`. This will also be
  generated automatically when running `snakemake import`.
